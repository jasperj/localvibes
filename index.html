      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I've built consumer software as a product manager for almost 10 years, but I've always wanted to build something on my own. Now that my social life is put on hold, there's no excuse not to finally get started.</p>

      <h2>Why Local Vibes?</h2>
      <p>I had a transformative experience that inspired me to make Local Vibes. In May 2017, on a family trip to NYC, we toured the 9/11 memorial in the afternoon and saw Come From Away on Broadway in the evening. The combination of the memorial and a
        show about the humanity in the aftermath of 9/11 was not intentional, but they complemented each other perfectly to create a truly profound experience. While seeing a show, eating at a restaurant, or going to a bar can be a good experience, I believe the best experiences are a combination of complementary activities.</p>

      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>For people who are planning a date or entertaining a friend visiting, Local Vibes makes it easy to quickly discover great local experiences. From classic pairings like tacos and a tequila bar, to a walk through central park for a
        sandwhich at Tavern on the Green, the complementary activities elevate the whole experience.</p>
